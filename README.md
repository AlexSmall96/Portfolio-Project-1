# VeGastronomy 

VeGastronomy is a fictional, fully plant based, fine dining restaurant based in Edinburgh, Scotland. The cuisine is based on classical dishes, reinvented with a vegan twist. The restaurant aims to fill the gap in the vegan niche of the Edinburgh catering industry, providing a truly remarkable dining experience while maintaining the restaurant's ethics and philosophy of being plant based. 

The title of the restuarant is a combination of Vegan and the word "Gastronomy" which is defined as "the art and knowledge involved in preparing and eating good food". 

This site is designed to attract customers, provide an overview of the restaurants philosophy, cuisine and style, and allow customers to make bookings.

# UX
## Target Audience

Although the idea behind this restaurant was to fill a gap in Edinburgh's vegan catering industry, and provide vegans with the oppurtunity to experience fine dining cuisine, the resturant is targeted towards everyone. It aims to showcase that you can still eat delicious food and be vegan. 


## Project Goals

This site is intended to give the public a concise yet alluring overview of the restaurant, to attract new customers. The site is intended to be intuitive and easy to follow, with lots of well positioned navigation links. 

## User Stories
### Site User
As a site user I want to:
 
- Understand what the business is.
- Understand the restaurant's philosophy and style.
- Easily navigate through different sections of the site.
- Learn more about what kind of food the restaurant offers.
- Easily book a table to visit the restaurant.
- View the restaurants social media links for more information or to contact the restaurant.

### Website Owner
As a site owner I want to:
 
- Present the restaurant in a way that attracts most customers.
- Present my ideas and philosophy behind the restaurant concisely and clearly.
- Provide an overview of the food the restaurant offers.

## Design Choices
The look of the site aims to be similar in style to other traditional fine dining restaurants. This drove me to use a clean background, with professional looking text. Some of the choice of style has a more modern feel to it, such as the footer icons, or the choice of font/letter spacing. This reflects the fact that vegan dining is a relatively modern trend.

### Colors
The white background of the main body aims to provide a stylish classical, look. This also ties into the aim of giving it a traditional fine dining feel. The grey in the margins was chosen so it would contrast with the main white section. The blue in the footer was used to give it a modern twist.

### Typography
The font used on the site is [Oxygen](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oxygen?query=oxygen) from google fonts. I thought this font looked professional yet relaxed.
 
The main heading is the largest font size, to capture the users attention when they first enter the site. The headers of each section are slightly smaller in font size and with a letter spacing. Again, I felt like this added to the relaxed yet professional feel. The headers of subsections, for example in the about section and the links to other pages, are smaller than the header sections and don't have letter spacing, but are still in bold. This helps the user to understand what pieces of text go together.

### Imagery
The images on the home page were chosen as they appear to be plant based dishes, and are beautifully presented, providing a good first impression of the restaurant's food. The three images on the menu page are designed to give a feel of the range of dishes the restaurant offers, with a main course dish, a dessert dish and raw ingredients being presented. The bookings page features an image of the restaurant. This was chosen as a user who visits the booking page is likely already convinced that they like the food, and the image of the restaurant allows them to imagine further what the experience of dining there would be like, enticing them to fill out the booking form.

## Site Structure and Features
The site is broken down into three main pages : Home, Menu and Bookings. There is an extra page that is accessed once the bookings form is filled in. Each page has :
 
- A header conisisting of the name of the restaurant and the navigation menu. This allows the user to easily navigate through the site, and provides a common section on each site to easily allow the customer to return to the home page.

- A footer containing social media links. This aims to allow users to easily get in contact with the restaurant, or find out more information on social media.

### The Home Page ###
- The home page is designed to catch the users attention with the two images, and provide a succinct description of the restaurant.

- The home page begins with the hero image and cover text, followed by an about section with text and an additional image of a dish. 

- There are then links to the menu and bookings page, before a section containing the opening hours and link to the top of the page. 
These additional links help improve the user experience by making it more convenient to navigate the site.

![](documentation/about-feature.png)
  ![](documentation/links-opening-hours.png)
### The Menu Page ###
- The menu page aims to provide a sample of what the dining experience is like at the restaurant, while the bookings page is designed to allow customers to easily request a table at the restaurant.

- The menu page contains pictures of three dishes, and a full menu, with dishes described in detail. 

- At the bottom of the menu is a link to the home page. Again, this helps improve the flow of the site and allows the user to easily navigate to the home page.

![](documentation/menu-items.png)
![](documentation/menu-link.png)
### The Bookings Page ###
- The bookings page is a convenient and easy to use method to allow the user to book a table.

- The bookings page features a picture of the restaurant, with a form to request a table underneath. 

- If all the fields are completed, the 'request table' button links to the extra page 'form-response.html'. This page contains the same image as the bookings page and features a thank you message along with a link to the home page.

![](documentation/restaurant.png)
![](documentation/form.png)
![](documentation/form-response-feature.png)
### Media Queries ###

The site contains media queries to resize hero, about and bookings images at a certain screen width. This helps to improve the flow of the website at smaller screen sizes and make it easier to follow for the user.See testing section for screenshots.

## Future Features

An additional feature that could be added to the site is the inclusion of more menus. This might look like the menu page having links to a tasting menu, a la carte menu, or drinks menu that open as a pdf on a seperate page.

The booking system could also be made more sophisticated, with the times the user can select being restricted to opening hours. 

## Testing
### Resizing Browser ###

Once I was happy with the overall layout and style of the project, I began testing. Firstly, I checked all pages in dev tools at the browser sizes : Mobile S - 320px, Mobile M - 375px, Mobile L - 425xp, Tablet 768px, Laptop - 1024px and 4K - 2560px, to ensure they maintained their structural integrity and looked visually appealing.
The menu and bookings pages looked good at all sizes but there were issues with the home page.
 
The first issue I noticed was at Mobile S - 320px, the Menu and Reservations links wouldn't fit on the same line. This looked unprofessional as the boxes weren't lined up.
 ![](documentation/links-overflow-before.png)
  I adjusted the width of the boxes to 40% which created space for them to be on the same line. I also changed 'Reservations' to 'Bookings' so it would fit in a smaller space. With this issue fixed, the home page looked good at this browser size.

![](documentation/links-overflow-after.png)

The home page maintained its structure at all other browser sizes except 4K - 2560px. At this size, the about secion was wider than the hero image. 

![](documentation/about-too-wide-before.png)

I added max-width: 1124px to the style of the about section and it solved the issue. I also noticed the cover text box had fallen below the hero image. This required me to change position: absolute to position : relative and remove the transform style.

![](documentation/about-too-wide-after.png)

The menu page looked good at all browser sizes, but at smaller screen widths some of the menu items were too squashed and some lines had only one word.

![](documentation/menu-item-before.png)

 I added a minimum width to the menu section to allow more space for the items at smaller browser sizes.

![](documentation/menu-item-after.png)

### Integrity of Images and Text ###
Although the above issues were the main problems when resizing the browser, I noticed the hero, about and bookings images weren't as clear at smaller browser sizes. On the home page, the hero image only showed a small slice on a Mobile S - 320px browser. 

![](documentation/hero-image-before.png)

To solve this issue, I introduced a media query, where at 1170px wide and below, the code implements  background-size: 100% auto along with other style changes. 

![](documentation/hero-image-after.png)

The same issue occured for the bookings image, and again I used a media query to implement a similar style change at 800px. 

![](documentation/bookings-image-before.png)

![](documentation/bookings-image-after.png)

The about section also had a similar problem when resizing the browser window, but this was also affected by the text positioning. 

![](documentation/about-image-before.png)

To solve this, I introduced a media query that placed the image below the text at 1170px wide and below. At this point, the text font size and the height of the section change. The result is much more visually pleasing and the layout flows alot better.

![](documentation/about-image-after.png)

### Form Functionality ###
When testing the functionality of the form, I realised the form could be inputted without entering any information. This could be confusing to the user, as a message confirming the request has been recieved appears upon completing the form. I added a required attribute to each input, as I decided each input was necessary information about the user/customer. After implementing this change, the user was unable to submit the form with any blank inputs and the below message appears under the blank input.

![](documentation/form-after.png)

 Each input is restricted to its own form of data as expected, for example number inputs only allow numbers and text inputs only allow text. The contact-no. input allows all characters as phone numbers may contain a "+" symbol.

### Links ###
To make the experience more complete for the user, I decided to add a home link on the form response page, which takes the user back to the home page. Although the menu page didn't have any structural issues with testing, I noticed it could be made more convenient for the user by adding a back to top link at the bottom of the menu, as the navigation bar isn't visible after scrolling to the bottom of the menu.

The external links in the footer all open on a new browser window.
