Website for a vegan fine dining restaurant based in Edinburgh, Scotland

After uploading the about image, I realised it wasn't in line with the hero image. (see issue_1.png)
I tried adjusting the margin on the hero image, and also styling the about section, but I realised the issue was due to the limit on the width of the hero image. As I wanted to use this picture as my hero image, I decided to wrap the body in a div that takes up a smaller percentage of the total width of the screen, and colour the remainder grey. 

I noticed the opening hours section and the contact section were spilling over the main body div into the grey background. (see issue_2.png) I realised this was because the links section above it was missing its closing tag.
